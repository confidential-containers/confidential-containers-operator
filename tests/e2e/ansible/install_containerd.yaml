    # by the containerd.io package. As a result we are hit by the following
    # problems:
    #
    #   - `kubeadm init` fails on preflight checks if containerd has 'cri'
    #   plug-in disabled. See https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/4581
    #   - Kubelet fails to scan the containerd endpoint after ccruntime is
    #   deployed then the node gets marked 'UnReady'. See
    #   https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/4581
    #
    # Those issues are solved by re-generating the containerd configuration
    # file with its defaults.
